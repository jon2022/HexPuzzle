# HexPuzzle

This is a project to develop a programme for checking potential solutions for a hexagonal puzzle.

The puzzle has seven hexagons, each of which has a different marking for each side.

These may be numbers, colours or images.

to solve the puzzle one hexagon should be placed in the centre and the other six placed around it so that all adjacent hexagon sides are matching.

The programmes have arrays of markers for each sides numbered from 1 to 6 in a given order and check all possible combinations of tile arrangements for potential solutions.

Written first in R, then in C++
